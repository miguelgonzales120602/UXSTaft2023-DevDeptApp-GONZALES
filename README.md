# UXSTaft2023-DevDeptApp-GONZALES
 Web application in partial fulfillment of UXS Taft Application for Web Devleopment Team. A web application made using ReactJS. Hosted via Vercel. Used Geek-Jokes as well as the Shibe-Online API. The website shows a combination of pictures of Shiba Inu dogs, as well as jokes from the Geek-Jokes API.

 How to Use:
 - Clicking each eye causes winking (no other functionality besides winking)
 - Clicking nose shows pop up of menu showing Shiba Inu Picture as well as Geek-Joke
 - Clicking on the mouth, causes all eyes to open (if there are closed)

Considerations:
- Some rendering of jokes can lead to errors due to toString method not working for some of the contents of the Geek-Jokes API.
